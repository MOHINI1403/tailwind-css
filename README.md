# Tailwind CSS â€“ A Utility First CSS Framework
### How Tailwind CSS Works??
    Before Lerning about how Tailwind Css Works We need to learn about "Atomic CSS"

    "Atomic CSS is the approach to CSS architecture that favours small, single-purpose classes with names based on visual function."

    Tailwind CSS, provides several of these opinionated, single-purpose utility classes that you can use directly inside your markup to design an element.

    The best part is, we do not have to write these utility classes ourselves and keep them in any global CSS file. We directly get them from Tailwind.

### How To Set Up Tailwind CSS
